Quickstart
==========


Installation
------------
To install this package:

#. Clone the `docsinfra repository`_
#. Install the Python package by running the following from the cloned repository's
   folder:

   .. code-block:: bash

         pip3 install -e .

.. warning::

   It is always recommended to use a Python virtual environment, such as `venv`_,
   when installing a Python package.


Initialization
--------------
For this tutorial it is assumed you have a git repository, managed on Github,
for which you wish to create documentation. Customarily, the documents will sit
in a ``docs`` folder under the repository's root. This is the setup assumed here.
